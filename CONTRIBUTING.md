## Development Setup

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python main.py
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

## Coding Style

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where possible
- Document functions with docstrings
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use meaningful variable names

### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add animation playback speed control

- Implement speed selector dropdown (0.5x to 10x)
- Update playback interval calculation
- Add UI controls in animation panel

Fixes #123
```

## Project Structure

- `backend/` - FastAPI backend
- `frontend/` - React + Three.js frontend
- `data/pds/` - PDS metadata JSON files
- `docs/` - Documentation

## Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Adding New Interstellar Objects

1. Add object to `backend/main.py` INTERSTELLAR_OBJECTS registry
2. Create PDS metadata JSON in `data/pds/`
3. Update color mapping in `frontend/src/components/ThreeJSViewer.tsx`
4. Test with real JPL Horizons data
